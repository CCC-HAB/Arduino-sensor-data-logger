Ingredients
-Arduino Uno
-Ethernet Shield
-BMP180
-4 jump wires
-USB cable

Downloads
1. Adafruit BMP085 Arduino Library (https://learn.adafruit.com/bmp085/using-the-bmp085)
2. Arduino’s 1.6.3 (http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
3. Data logging code (https://github.com/hnelson7/Arduino-sensor-data-logger/archive/master.zip)


Steps
1. Install the Arduino (IDE)
2. Install adafruit’s BMP085 library
3. Open up the data logging code from github
4. Put together your Arduino, ethernet shield, and sensor
- Attach ethernet shield to arduino
- Attach Sensor to bread board
- Run wires from: 3.3V to VIN, GND to GND, A4 to SDA, A5 to SCL
- Plug into computer
5. Verify
6. Run

This is the most stripped down instructions to setting up and running for your first time. Next I’m gonna go over some of the commands and how to tailor them to your needs.
